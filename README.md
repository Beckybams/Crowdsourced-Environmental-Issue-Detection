🎯 Objectives

Collect and process synthetic or real crowdsourced environmental data.

Develop ML models for classifying and detecting environmental issues.

Provide visualizations and reports to highlight problem areas.

Support decision-making with actionable environmental intelligence.

🛠️ Features

Data preprocessing pipeline for crowdsourced reports.

Synthetic dataset generation for experimentation.

Machine learning models for detection and classification.

Exportable Excel reports with detected issues.

Insights dashboard for environmental stakeholders.
